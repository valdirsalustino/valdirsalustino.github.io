        <h2> Getting Involved in HEP </h2>
        <p>
        At some point during my high schools classes, I read a nice paper about the puzzle of solar neutrino disappearance and its fascinating flavour oscillation.  Afterwards, I decided to do a bachelor in Physics.  Conveniently, during my undergraduate program, I got a scholarship to work at the nuclear neutrino research, project called <a href="http://lsd.cbpf.br/neutrinos/">Angra neutrinos</a>, in Rio de Janeiro. I made contributions in the studies of cosmic ray's background, mainly neutrons flux through the detector at sea level. <a href="http://lsd.cbpf.br/neutrinos/doc/angranotes/AngraNote_015.pdf">Check it out</a>.

        <h2> Master Degree </h2>
        <p>
        At the end of my undergraduate, I had decided to focus on phenomenology of Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM). Models with extended symmetry <img src="figs/latex-image-1.pdf" height=20px > brought my attention because 
        seemed a more complete version of SM, with several new particles, including
        bi-leptons. You can check my results <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.87.115014">here</a>. 
        </p>

        <h2> PhD Degree </h2>
        <p>
        During my PhD program at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro I started at the LHCb collaboration, where I am member today.
        I have made contributions to the Technical Design Report of the Silicon Inner Tracker prototype for the LHCb tracker upgrade program, Calorimeters sub-detectors, Beam-Gas-Vertexing (BGV) experiment and analyses within the Quantum Electroweak and Exotica Physics Analyses Working Group. You can find my PhD thesys <a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2212758">here</a>.</p>
